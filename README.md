## Academic Integrity

I care a lot about academic honesty. Because of this, I've done several things:

- No code is generated by GitHub Copilot or any AI, it has been disabled.
- No evidence or sources are generated or found by AI, all research was done by me. Google AI included.
- All text was written, proofread, edited, and placed by me.
- All design work was done by me.
